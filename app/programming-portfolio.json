      "description": "**Philippine Marine Corps Roleplay Game** is an immersive roleplaying experience on Roblox, developed using Lua. With a visit count of over 23,000 players, players can enlist in the Philippine Marine Corps, undergo training, and participate in various military operations and missions within a dynamic virtual environment.\n\nHere I learned:\n\n- Scripting complex gameplay systems in **Lua** (player progression, training flows, mission logic)\n- Designing intuitive in-game UI and HUD elements\n- Implementing networked multiplayer features and optimizing client-server performance\n- Managing assets, animations, and visual effects for immersive feedback\n- Using version control and collaborative workflows for a live game\n\n[Game Link](https://www.roblox.com/games/110533446843258/Philippine-Marine-Corps-RP#!/about)",

      "description": "**Jedis** (Java Redis) is my attempt at replicating all features of [Redis](https://redis.io/) in Java. This project involved implementing core Redis functionalities such as data persistence, in-memory caching, and pub/sub messaging. It was a deep dive into distributed systems, focusing on performance optimization and thread-safe operations.\n\nKey Features:\n- Support for common Redis data structures like strings, hashes, lists, and sets\n- Implementation of a lightweight in-memory database\n- Pub/Sub messaging for real-time communication\n- Thread-safe design for concurrent operations\n\nThrough this project, I gained hands-on experience with Java concurrency, data serialization, and designing scalable systems.\n\n[Source Code](https://github.com/Coralise/Java-Redis)",
